This script searches the [Copyright Licensing Agency's](http://www.cla.co.uk) database for permissions. Note that I'm not affiliated with the CLA, although I did ask them before making this code public. I'd like to thank the people I spoke to for their help. They can be contacted about their API at <api@cla.co.uk>.

# Usage

The script can be run from the command line as follows

```
$ python3 cla.py [--LicenceType, -L {132,134,136,137,140,141,143,154,230,232}] [--UsageType, -U {1,2,8}] [--ISBNname, -I ISBN_NAME] [--key, -K KEY] <file>
```

Defaults have been set for the named arguments: 132 (a Higher Education licence), 2 (scanning), 'ISBN', and 'key.txt', respectively.

# What it does

The script looks at the file given as an argument, which must be an Excel file with extension '.xlsx' or '.xls'. (The script will find a file with the name given if no extension is specified and one with a suitable extension exists.) The first worksheet in the workbook is inspected for a column header that matches the ISBNname argument. The entries in that column are used to query the CLA's database. A key is read from the key argument; in order to use the script you will need to obtain a key (also known as the 'RequestSystem') from the CLA. The responses from the database are written to a column called 'Responses' in a new Excel file based on the following mapping:

* NegativeHeader -> 'Negative'
* NeutralHeader -> 'Neutral'
* PositiveHeader -> 'Positive'
* WarningHeader -> 'Warning'

The new file will have the name of the original with the date (in ISO format) appended. A log file called 'cla.log' will be written containing full details of the requests sent and responses received. This is overwritten by each new call to the script.

# Requirements

The script uses some modules that are not part of the standard Python 3 installation.

* [Openpyxl](https://pythonhosted.org/openpyxl/) (tested with version 2.0.4)
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) (tested with version 2.3.0)
